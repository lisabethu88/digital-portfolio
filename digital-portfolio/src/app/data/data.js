  reflection: [
    "We are all with various skill sets coming into his assignment and found each other's strengths in each category to complete it. Ryan and Kim worked on the wireframes and Lisa had strong coding capabilities and worked on the coding and implementation of the wireframes.",
    "We wanted to keep our website design simple and clear for our target audience who would be hiring us to design websites, copy, logos and other digital media. We kept colors interesting but also slightly muted and fonts in colors that are readable and clear. To keep the audience engaged we kept the photos centered on the home page so they are the first thing the viewer sees when entering. This prioritizes the design element of the website.",
    "We worked together to analyze the flow and user experience of the website to ensure it was visually interesting and functional. Some challenges we faced while working on this assignment was creating a functional website. For example, identifying an API that aligned with our website's needs was crucial. We selected Pexels because it offered a free plan with up to 200 API calls per hour. However, this choice came with a trade-off in terms of speed. We could have improved the project by placing greater emphasis on accessibility and optimizing speed. Also due to some of us being new to coding and web development, this became a great opportunity for Kim and Ryan to learn some coding through Lisa and understand how a website is built. It will be beneficial when moving forward in the development process of our final website.",
